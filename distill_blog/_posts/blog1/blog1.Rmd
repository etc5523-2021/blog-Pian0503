# Data description

There are two datasets used to analyze the change of disease-related data(cases, deaths, mortality rate) and the efficiency of vaccinations during the COVID-19 phase in Sweden. The data of cases and deaths is obtained from [the World Health Organization (WHO)](https://covid19.who.int/table), while data on COVID-19 vaccinations is sourced from the publicly available [Github repository](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data/vaccinations) created by [Our World in Data (OWID)](https://ourworldindata.org/).


## Structure of data

All variables included in the two datasets are listed below:

```{r echo=FALSE,eval=TRUE}
data_structure <- data.frame(Variables = c("Country",
                         "Date_reported",
                         "New_cases",
                         "New_deaths",
                         "total_vaccinations",
                         "people_vaccinated",
                         "people_fully_vaccinated"),
           Types = c("character",
                     "date",
                     "double",
                     "double",
                     "double",
                     "double",
                     "double"),
           Description = c("name of the country",
                           "date of the observation",
                           "new confirmed cases of COVID-19",
                           "new deaths attributed to COVID-19",
                           "total number of doses administered,each individual dose is counted",
                           "total number of people who received at least one vaccine dose.",
                           "total number of people who received all doses prescribed by the vaccination protocol"))


kable(data_structure, caption = "Data Structure of chosen datasets") %>%
  kable_paper(bootstrap_options = "striped",full_width = F)
